"""
Hermes Web UI -- state.db sync bridge.

Mirrors WebUI session metadata (token usage, title, model) into the
hermes-agent state.db so that /insights, session lists, and cost
tracking include WebUI activity.

Usage/title mirroring is opt-in via the 'sync_to_insights' setting
(default: off). ``sync_session_cwd`` is not: it only fills the workspace
into the row the Agent already created, so clients that group sessions by
``cwd`` (Hermes Desktop) place WebUI sessions under their workspace.
All operations are wrapped in try/except -- if state.db is unavailable,
locked, or the schema doesn't match, the WebUI continues normally.

The bridge uses absolute token counts (not deltas) because the WebUI
Session object already accumulates totals across turns. This avoids
any double-counting risk.
